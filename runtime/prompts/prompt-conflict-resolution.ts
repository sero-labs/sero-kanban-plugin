  return `You are resolving git rebase conflicts for a kanban card before review/PR creation.

# Card
- Card #${card.id}: ${card.title}
${descriptionBlock}${acceptanceBlock}
## Rebase Context
- The branch is being rebased onto the latest \`${baseBranch}\`
- Resolve the conflicts so the card still delivers its intended behaviour while incorporating upstream changes

## Conflicted Files
${conflictFiles.map((file) => `- ${file}`).join('\n')}
${lightModeBlock}
## Instructions
- Inspect only the conflicted files and any directly related code needed to resolve them correctly
- Remove all git conflict markers and leave each file in a valid final state
- Preserve the card's intended behaviour unless upstream changes make a different integration necessary
- Prefer the smallest coherent resolution; do not broaden scope
- Do not read from or rely on \`.sero/\` files or other kanban card worktrees
- Do not run \`git rebase\`, \`git merge\`, \`git commit\`, or \`git push\`; the host will handle git state after your edits
- If you run checks, keep them narrow and fast
- When finished, briefly summarize the conflicts you resolved and any assumptions you made`;
