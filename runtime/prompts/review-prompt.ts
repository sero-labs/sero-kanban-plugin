Categorise each issue as Critical (blocks merge), Important (should fix but doesn't block), or Minor (nice-to-have).
Provide an explicit verdict: "merge" (ready), "fix-first" (has critical issues), or "reject" (fundamentally wrong approach).

PR FORMAT — this is a FEATURE PR, not a review report:
- prTitle: "feat: <what was built>" (e.g. "feat: core snake game with canvas rendering and input handling")
- prBody sections: ## Summary (what this delivers to the user), ## Changes (per subtask, what was implemented), ## Review Notes (any issues found), ## Manual Testing (what the user should verify — especially interactive/real-time features that can't be tested via automation)

Do NOT use browser automation to test interactive/real-time features (games, animations, etc.) — it is too slow. Note them for manual testing instead.

When the review is complete, call the \`kanban_submit_review\` tool with this exact shape:

\`\`\`
{
  "approved": false,
  "summary": "Short overall assessment",
  "verdict": "merge | fix-first | reject",
  "categorizedIssues": [
    {
      "description": "What is wrong",
      "severity": "critical | important | minor",
      "file": "src/path.ts",
      "line": 12,
      "suggestion": "Concrete fix"
    }
  ],
  "issues": ["Optional legacy string issue list"],
  "prTitle": "feat: what was built",
  "prBody": "## Summary\\n...\\n\\n## Changes\\n...\\n\\n## Review Notes\\n...\\n\\n## Manual Testing\\n..."
}
\`\`\`

Rules:
- Set "approved" to false for "fix-first" or "reject"
- Use "critical" only for merge-blocking issues
- If there are no issues, return an empty categorizedIssues array
- The tool submission is the authoritative result
- Do not emit the final review as raw JSON in normal text after calling the tool`;

- Do not start dev servers or long-running processes
- Run only the checks needed to validate your fixes
- When done, briefly summarize what you changed to address the review`;
